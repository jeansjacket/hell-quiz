        <h2>Congratulations, <span class="name"></span>, you're stuck in Limbo!</h2>
        <p>Limbo, the first circle of the abyss, is an inferior form of heaven reserved for unbaptized babes and virtuous pagans from antiquity, like Cicero, Aristotle, and Virgil. If you're lucky, you'll also get to meet Lavinia, whose hair catching on fire was seen as a good omen for the empire. Or get to go on an extremely metal tour of all Hell's circles, guided by Virgil.</p>

        <p>Together, you'll live forever in a castle with seven gates that symbolize the seven virtues, which seems like far too many gates. Don't get lost! Or do—you have forever afterall! </p>

      <div class = "results" id="second">
        <h2>Look at you, <span class="name"></span>, you bawdy soul. You've been condemned to the Second Circle of Hell.</h2>

        <p>The Second Circle of Hell is for lovers. According to <em>Inferno</em>, this circle was designed for those who were overcome by lust—or committed adultery—in life. In this Circle, you'll get to hang out with Cleopatra in a relentless and howling storm, symbolizing your restless desires for earthly pleasures. Better pack an umbrella!</p>

        <h2>Great news, <span class="name"></span>: you get to suffer for eternity in the Third Circle of Hell!</h2>

        <p>Are you ready to get a little messy? In <em>Inferno</em>, the Third Circle is where the gluttonous spend forever in a vat of vile slush, guarded by a three-headed worm monster. No one knows exactly what's in the slush, but it's considered a delicacy in the more adventurous walks of the afterlife. Don't worry, no one will make you eat it. You'll just have to always-wallow in it as punishment for your overindulgence.</p>

        <h2>Shake your moneymaker, <span class="name"></span>. You've saved up enough sin for an eternity in the Fourth Circle of Hell!</h2>

        <p>Sure hope you're a sportsfan. <p>In <em>Inferno</em>, Dante and Virgil stumble upon an eternal, and like very slowmoving, joust between two groups of people: those who hoarded possessions and those who spent lavishly. Instead of lances, the participants use heavy weights that symbolize their greed in life.</p>

        <p>The fesitivities are presided over by a character called Pluto—a fan-favorite who made it to Pagan/Christian cross-over universe.</p>

        <p>Are you wrathful? How about sullen? Do you wake up in the morning with your hands clenched into tight little fists? Are your teeth worn to the gums from a lifetime of nights spent anger-grinding? Sounds like you belong in the Fifth Circle of Hell, friend.</p>

        <p>After a short ferry ride through the Styx, you'll enter an eternal slop fight just below the surface of a foul swamp. Struggle and snarl forever, gurgling and punching through slime, just like you did in life.</p>

        <h2>You've really done it this time, <span class="name"></span>! You've earned a forever home in the Sixth Circle of Hell!</h2>

        <p>Beyond the red towers of the city of Dis, you'll find the Sixth Circle of Hell—the perfect place for you, you wiley heretic. Here you'll spend an eternity in a flaming tomb with the other iconoclasts and dissidents. Putting you all in one place is a surefire way to make sure you'll never peek out of your fire-coffins and conspire to disrupt all nine circles of the Underworld, freeing some of history's most metal and most evil offenders. No way in Hell you'd do that, right?</p>

      <div class = "results" id="seventh">
        <h2>Oof, <span class="name"></span>, really? You're going straight to the Seventh Circle of Hell</h2>

        <p>The Seventh Circle is tailor-made for the truly violent. Lucky for you, true crime is in right now. You'll get to live in the same neighborhood as your favorite serial killers. John, Jeff, Ted, Ed—the whole crew—will be there wallowing in a river of boiling blood and fire just as they did in life. Other Seventh Circle activities include Eaten by Harpies and Torn to Pieces by Dogs.</p>

        <h2>Great job, <span class="name"></span>! You're headed the Eighth Circle of Hell for all that lying you did in life.</h2>

        <p>Heaven must have spent <em>a lot</em> of money on the Eighth Circle, a buried gem built for frauds of all sorts. Is it overkill to hire thirteen demon-dragons to guard perpetrators of non-violent crimes? That's for you to decide.</p>

        <p>In this circle, also called Malebolge or "evil ditches", you'll get to live alongside all of the panderers, seducers, and flatterers you've encountered in life across a cavern of ten stoney ditches. In each ditch you'll find activities like: Excrement March, Demon Poking, 90-degree Head Turn, Constantly Ablaze, and Leprosy. Magicians and sorcerers also frequent the Eighth Circle—making it a truly enchanted place.</p>

      <div class = "results" id="ninth">
        <h2>Yeesh, <span class="name"></span>, what'd you do to earn the Ninth Circle of Hell as the base of your eternal damnation?</h2>

        <p>The Ninth Circle, also known as Cocytus, is where the higher-ups send people who've committed personal treachery. Think: have you ever betrayed your friends or family members? What was that fight about last Christmas? Come on! There must have been something. You have exactly one eternity to reflect. In the meantime, here's some more information about your new/old fovever home.</p>

        <p>You've scored some prime real estate as close to Satan as you can get outside of California. And forget waterfront, you'll live <em>inside</em> a frozen lake. Here, your eyes will freeze to your sockets, so you're denied the comfort of weeping. If that punishment doesn't fit the crime, you may find yourself getting <em>a head</em>. Your disembodied head will gnaw on the head of another traitor, all day every day. Other activities include: Encapsulated in Ice and Twisted in Every Conceivable Position.</p>
