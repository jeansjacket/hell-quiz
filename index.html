        <h3 class="description">It turns out, it's pretty easy to get here. Since the beginning of human kind, approximately 100.8 billion people have died. As you might imagine, hell is a pretty big place. When Dante visited, he found nine layers—so where, exactly, will you spend eternity?</h3>

      <div class = "results" id="limbo">
        <h2>Congratulations, <span class="name"></span>, you're stuck in Limbo!</h2>
        <p>Limbo is an inferior form of heaven reservered for unbaptized babes and virtuous pagans from antiquity, like Cicero, Aristotle, and Virgil. If you're lucky, you'll also get to meet Lavinia, whose hair catching on fire was seen as a good omen for the empire. Or get to go on an extremely metal tour of all Hell's circles, guided by Virgil.</p>

        <p>Together, you'll live forever in a castle with seven gates that symbolize the seven virtues, which seems like far too many gates. Don't get lost! Or do—you have forever afterall! </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "results" id="second">
        <h2>Look at you, <span class="name"></span>, you bawdy soul. You've been condemned to the Second Circle of Hell.</h2>

        <p>The Second Circle of Hell is for lovers. According to <em>Inferno</em>, this circle was designed for those who were overcome by lust—or committed adultery—in life. In this Circle, you'll get to hang out with Cleopatra in a relentless and howling storm, symbolizing your restless desires for earthly pleasures. Better pack an umbrella!</p>
      </div>

      <div class = "results" id="third">
        <h2>Great news, <span class="name"></span>: you get to suffer for eternity in the Third Circle of Hell!</h2>

        <p>Get ready to get a little messy! In <em>Inferno</em>, the Third Circle is where the gluttonous live out forever in a vat of vile slush, guarded by a worm monster. No one knows exactly what's in the slush, but it's considered a delecacy in the more adventurous areas of the afterlife. Don't worry, no one will make you eat it. You'll just have to sit in it as punishment for your overindulgence.</p>
      </div>

      <div class = "results" id="fourth">
        <h2>Shake you're moneymaker, <span class="name"></span>. You've saved up enough sign for an eternity in the Fourth Circle of Hell!</h2>

        Sure hope you're a sportsfan. <p>In <em>Inferno</em>, Dante and Virgil stumble upon an eternal, and possibly very slow, joust between two groups of people: those who hoarded possessions and those who spent lavishly. Instead of lances, the participants use heavy weights that symbolize their greed in life.</p>

        <p>The fesitivities are presided over by a character called Pluto, a fan-favorite who made it to Pagan/Christian cross-over world.</p>
      </div>

      <div class = "results" id="fifth">
        <h2>Great job, <span class="name"></span>. You're in for infinite torture in the Fifth Circle of Hell!</h2>

        <p>Are you wrathful? How about sullen? Do you wake up in the morning with your hands clenched into tight little fists? Are your teeth worn to the gums from a lifetime of nights spent anger-grinding? Sounds like you belong in the Fifth Circle of Hell, friend.</p>

        <p>Just a short boat ride away from the Fourth, you'll enter an eternal fight just below the surface of a vast body of water. Struggle forever, gurgling and punching, just like you did in life.</p>
      </div>

      <div class = "results" id="sixth">
        <h2>You've really done it this time, <span class="name"></span>! You've earned a forever home in the Sixth Circle of Hell!</h2>

        <p>The Sixth Circle of Hell is the perfect place for you, you wiley heretic. Here you'll spend an eternity in a flaming tomb with the other iconoclasts and dissidents. Putting you all in one place is a surefire way to make sure you'll never conspire to disrupt all nine circles of the Underworld, freeing some of history's most metal and most evil offenders. No way in Hell you'd do that, right?</p>
      </div>

      <div class = "results" id="seventh">
        <h2>Oof, <span class="name"></span>, really? You're going straight to the Seventh Circle of Hell</h2>
      </div>

      <div class = "results" id="eighth">
        <h2>Off, <span class="name"></span>, really? You're going straight to the Seventh Circle of Hell</h2>
      </div>

      <div class = "results" id="ninth">
        <h2>Congratulations, <span class="name"></span>, you get to suffer for eternity in the ninth layer of Hell!</h2>
      </div>

      <div class = "results" id="center">
        <h2>Hey, <span class="name"></span>, you're supposed to be suffering for eternity in the Center of Hell—made just for you!</h2>

        <p>Did you really think you could fool this quiz, you wiley devil, you? Get back to your frozen lake at the center of the Earth.
